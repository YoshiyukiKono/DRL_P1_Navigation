# Project Report

## Learning Algorithm

#### hyperparameters 

### The model architectures for neural networks.

## Plot of Rewards

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. 

### The number of episodes needed to solve the environment.

|  Model  |  The number of episode  |
| ---- | ---- |
|  Base  |  ```
Episode 800	Average Score: 15.70
Episode 900	Average Score: 15.29
Episode 940	Average Score: 16.01
Environment solved in 840 episodes!	Average Score: 16.01
```

|  Prioritized Experience Replay  |  TD  |

## Ideas for Future Work

The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
