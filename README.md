# DRL_P1_Navigation

## Project Details

For this project, you will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

### the state

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. 

### action spaces

Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

* 0 - move forward.
* 1 - move backward.
* 2 - turn left.
* 3 - turn right.

### when the environment is considered solved

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
