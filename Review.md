# Review

If you wish to study the subject further, here are few of my recommendations:

1. [A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/02/19/a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning.html) briefly go over the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), from fundamental concepts to classic algorithms [WARNING] This is a long read.
2. [Policy Gradient Algorithms](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html) Looks deep into policy gradient, why it works, and many new policy gradient algorithms proposed in recent years: vanilla policy gradient, actor-critic, off-policy actor-critic, A3C, A2C, DPG, DDPG, D4PG, MADDPG, TRPO, PPO, ACER, ACTKR, and Soft AC.

## DQN

1. [Implementing DQN (Double and Duelling) in TF](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/05/05/implementing-deep-reinforcement-learning-models.html) Implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning Models with Tensorflow (the most popular DL library) + OpenAI Gym
2. Dueling Network Architectures [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)
3. Double Q-learning [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.0646)
4. Dynamic Frame skip Deep Q Network (DFDQN) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05365)
5. Rainbow [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298): Combining Improvements like Duels, Double, Distributional techniques on DQN.
